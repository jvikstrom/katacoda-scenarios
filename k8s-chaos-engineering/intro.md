Chaos Engineering is a way of testing the resiliency of distributed systems. The way we do that is that we turn off parts of the system in a controlled manner. The idea is that this way bugs that are induced by failures in a distributed setting will be uncovered. As more of these bugs are fixed this will lead to improved resiliency and decreased downtime over time.

"Kube-monkey" is a tool to start causing chaos in Kubernetes clusters. After it is deployed it will start randomly turning off pods in the cluster. It leverages the Kubernetes API to find pods and turn them off. This means we need to give the deployment special permissions. The easy way is deploying in the "kube-system" namespace - but this means it will be granted way more permissions than it requires. In this tutorial, following the principle of least privilege we are going to deploy it with only the permissions it requires.
