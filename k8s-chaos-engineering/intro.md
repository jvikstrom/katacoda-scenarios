Chaos Engineering is a way of testing the resiliency of distributed systems. The idea is that by turning off parts of the system in a controlled manner bugs that are induced by failures in a distributed settings are uncovered in a controlled way. As more of these bugs are fixed this will lead to improved resiliency and decreased downtime over time.

"Kube-monkey" is a tool to start enabling chaos in Kubernetes clusters. After it is deployed it will start randomly turn off pods in the cluster. It leverages the Kubernetes API to find pods and turn them off. This means we need to give the deployment special permissions. The easy way is deploying the in the "kube-system" - but this means it will be granted way more permissions than it requires. Following the principle of least privilege we are going to deploy it with only the permissions it required in this tutorial.
